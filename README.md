The current way the ban system in Crab Game works is that when you close your lobby, all the players you banned will be unbanned. However, with this mod, whenever you ban someone, their name and Steam ID are stored in a text file located in your bepinex plugins folder. Each time you create a new lobby, those players will be automatically be banned again, preventing them from joining your lobby. If you wish to unban someone, you can open the text file located in your bepinex plugins folder named "BannedPlayers" and remove their name and ID.
